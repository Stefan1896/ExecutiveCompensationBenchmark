# ExecutiveCompensationBenchmark
The goal of this project is to create a shiny app which shows remuneration levels as well as company financials of top S&amp;P 500 companies.

The app can be found [here](https://swerner1896.shinyapps.io/ExecutiveCompensationBenchmarking/)

The data was pulled according to the method described [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/elky96/remuneration-benchmark).
